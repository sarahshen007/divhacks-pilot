                    As we are adapting in a post-COVID world, we have witnessed big changes to education. From the many perspectives of a student, a teacher, and a learner, this Education Track invites you to think about how we can better the way we are learning and teaching. This is not exclusive to the topic of bettering remote learning only, but also envisioning how education can empower a wider population as we look into the traditional classroom settings.

                        <p>
                            DivHacks is Columbia University's premier student-led annual diversity hackathon. DivHacks was founded in the spring of 2017 as a collaboration between three student tech organizations at Columbia University to promote diversity in computer science, specifically gender and racial diversity. Over the past four years, DivHacks has welcomed attendees from all over the tri-state area.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We strive to create an empowering and inspirational space for students who are historically underrepresented in the tech industry, addressing the systemic exclusion and erasure of those who exist outside the standard definition of what it means to be a computer scientist. Our goal is an experience that not only reimagines what diversity should look like in the tech industry but gives students the tools to use technology to implement change.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This year's theme is focused on how we can use technology to reimagine and influence a future post-COVID world.
